It is not limited to war or explicit clashes: it emerges within collective life as friction, as a continuous confrontation between competing needs, systems, and visions.\nIt is not a punctual episode but a latent and distributed condition. It takes on asymmetric, often invisible forms, embedded in cultural practices, social relations, and infrastructures. Its logic is not confined to violence: it also structures coexistence, shaping who holds privilege and who is pushed to the margins.\nExploring distributed conflicts means reading the present as a field where techniques of offense multiply and blur into the infrastructures society depends on. The goal is to generate critical devices, scenarios, and questions that probe the ambiguous nature of conflict as a diffuse condition in a post-territorial age.\n",

Quercetin, a natural compound, can eliminate these senescent fat cells by reducing cellular stress and inflammation. Senescence happens when DNA damage or oxidative stress triggers protective pathways that stop cells from dividing. Various molecular processes control this, including how cells repair DNA and modify their proteins. Two therapeutic approaches are emerging: senolytics (drugs that remove senescent cells) and senomorphics (drugs that reduce their harmful secretions). Both show promise for treating aging-related conditions.",

In 19th century Britain, Plymouth ran 16½ minutes behind Greenwich, forcing travelers to constantly adjust their watches. The railways drove standardization—by 1847, they adopted Greenwich Mean Time for timetables, though local towns resisted this \"railway-time aggression\" until GMT became legal in 1880. The concept evolved further: in 1884, an international conference established Greenwich as the prime meridian for a \"universal day.\" By 1960, scientists created Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which combines atomic clock precision with Earth's rotation by adding leap seconds when needed. UTC transformed from a navigator's tool into the global time standard used today.",

The setup includes three random digit generators made from air pumps and colored balls, a cluster of Raspberry Pi computers, and a dashboard that visualizes the status and locations of labor assignments. The system selects candidates and job assignments from a pool of 30 million Americans using random numbers generated by the system. The project critiques the mechanization of labor and the abstraction of human work into data, challenging the assumptions underlying contemporary labor markets.",

A board of scientists meets twice yearly to adjust the clock based on world events. It reached its closest point—89 seconds to midnight—in January 2025. The clock has moved backward during periods of cooperation, like after the 1963 Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (12 minutes to midnight) and the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (17 minutes). The Doomsday Clock attempts to quantify existential risk through a simple, urgent visual metaphor.",

While North Americans typically feel uncomfortable with more than a second of conversational silence, Asians are comfortable with pauses lasting one to two minutes, using silence to demonstrate careful consideration before responding. This cultural practice extends to hierarchical workplace settings, where remaining silent in the presence of authority shows deference and helps maintain face-saving—avoiding public disagreement or embarrassment. In contrast, Western cultures often interpret silence as disengagement, lack of knowledge, or awkwardness, leading to significant cross-cultural miscommunication in business and international settings.Retry",
