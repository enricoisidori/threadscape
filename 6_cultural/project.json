It is not limited to war or explicit clashes: it emerges within collective life as friction, as a continuous confrontation between competing needs, systems, and visions.\nIt is not a punctual episode but a latent and distributed condition. It takes on asymmetric, often invisible forms, embedded in cultural practices, social relations, and infrastructures. Its logic is not confined to violence: it also structures coexistence, shaping who holds privilege and who is pushed to the margins.\nExploring distributed conflicts means reading the present as a field where techniques of offense multiply and blur into the infrastructures society depends on. The goal is to generate critical devices, scenarios, and questions that probe the ambiguous nature of conflict as a diffuse condition in a post-territorial age.\n",

While States control space, peoples without territory could control meaningful time—transforming their cyclical traditions into tools of sovereignty. They would force the world to synchronize with their cultural rhythms instead of succumbing to the linear time of forced progress. It is an act of self-determination that completely bypasses the logics of territorial control, shifting the conflict to a plane where indigenous peoples hold an insurmountable advantage: the authenticity of their relationship with natural and cultural cycles.",

What would happen if people elected digital figures as their own deities, creating communities where their digital figures and associated traditions are sacred?\n\nThe time of consumption, imposed by mass culture, pushes us to worship celebrities who follow the linear rhythm of success and fame. Sacred time, conversely, becomes the time of these digital figures, revered based on cycles of creation, interaction, and sharing within a community, rather than a rigid marketing plan.\n\nThis represents a reconfiguration of power. While the media and entertainment industry control the space of celebrity, people without an industry behind them could control meaningful time, transforming their own digital figures into tools of sovereignty. They would force the dominant culture to synchronize with their rhythms of worship, rather than forcing them to submit to the linear time of manufactured success.",

He is known for placing figures dressed in vibrant \"African\" wax fabrics—a material actually invented in Europe and popularized through colonial trade—into classic scenes of European aristocracy and history.\n\nThis creates a powerful visual tension. The fabric itself is a hybrid object, symbolizing both African identity and its colonial manipulation. Shonibare's art does not seek a \"pure\" cultural root but instead masterfully fuses these historically antagonistic symbols. His work challenges us to accept that modern identity is a complex and contested blend of roots and contamination, rather than a simple, singular",
