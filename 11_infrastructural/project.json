It is not limited to war or explicit clashes: it emerges within collective life as friction, as a continuous confrontation between competing needs, systems, and visions.\nIt is not a punctual episode but a latent and distributed condition. It takes on asymmetric, often invisible forms, embedded in cultural practices, social relations, and infrastructures. Its logic is not confined to violence: it also structures coexistence, shaping who holds privilege and who is pushed to the margins.\nExploring distributed conflicts means reading the present as a field where techniques of offense multiply and blur into the infrastructures society depends on. The goal is to generate critical devices, scenarios, and questions that probe the ambiguous nature of conflict as a diffuse condition in a post-territorial age.\n",

By the late 1960s, many units were abandoned, and the complex became a national example of failed public housing policy.

Within just a few years many residents demanded rehousing, and the complex gained a reputation for neglect and danger.

This profile acts as an entry ticket: the more interesting or attractive the tourist appears according to established social criteria, the greater the chances of being chosen.\nEach resident has the daily task of selecting a certain number of tourists to admit. Visitors with the most votes receive special privileges, such as exclusive access to events, discounts, or unique experiences.\nThe system introduces a unique dynamic: tourists themselves become attractions. As they pass by, other visitors and residents can leave reviews and ratings, creating a sort of public reputation and influencing future selections. Cities, meanwhile, compete with each other to attract the \"most desirable\" tourists, transforming the tourist experience into a global juggling act. for example tourists must have certain characteristics to access",

The distribution by investment intention is broken down as follows: 40% for forestry, 33% for other purposes, particularly mining, and 26% for agriculture. 67% of the area covered by agreements has ongoing operations, 25% is in the start-up phase, 5% of the area has operations abandoned, and 3% has not yet started. (image 1)\n\nINVESTOR COUNTRIES AND TARGETS OF LAND GRABBING:\nThe chart illustrates the top 10 countries with concluded and unconcluded agreements, expressed in millions of hectares. It shows that the Russian Federation is by far the country receiving the most foreign land investments, followed by Peru (especially for mining) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (for agricultural monocultures and mining). This is followed by countries with large tropical and equatorial rainforests, such as Indonesia, Brazil, and Gabon, where investments are driving deforestation for monoculture agriculture, livestock farming, and mining.

It denounces violence and agrarian injustice, promotes land reform, and collects data on rural conflicts in Brazil, becoming one of the main reference sources on these issues.\n\nThe article presents an overview of partial data (January-August 2021) collected by the Pastoral Land Commission (CPT) on rural conflicts in Brazil, highlighting a sharp increase in violence over land occupation and ownership. 418 territories were recorded as affected, with marked increases in “home destruction,” “expropriation,” “expulsion,” and “land grabbing.” Deaths “due to conflict” rose from 9 (2020) to 103 (2021), of which 101 were indigenous Yanomami. Of the 26 homicides linked to rural conflicts, 6 were landless workers (5 in the state of Rondônia) and 3 were quilombolas in Maranhão. The article also denounces the invasion of Yanomami territories by illegal miners, with acts of violence, water contamination, disease, environmental destruction, and cases of children “swept up in dredges.”",

A case in point is San Mariano (Philippines), where Green Future Innovations Inc. expropriated peasant lands to grow sugarcane, causing environmental degradation, pollution, respiratory diseases, and threats to farmers, who have lost income and security.\n\nLarge-scale renewable energy projects, such as dams, wind turbines, and solar farms, have caused forced displacement and environmental damage. Examples include the Lower Sesan 2 dam in Cambodia, which has displaced up to 5,000 people; the K Rail project in India risks displacing 20,000 families. PANAP estimates that renewable infrastructure requires approximately 300,000 hectares of land, resulting in the loss of homes and livelihoods.\n\n",

However, our data on killings does not capture the true scale of the problem. In some countries, the situation facing defenders is hard to gauge – restrictions on a free press, or where the independent monitoring of attacks on defenders is not taking place, can lead to underreporting. Land disputes and environmental damage, two of the prominent underlying causes behind communities’ activism, can also be difficult to monitor in parts of the world  affected by conflict.\nWe know that beyond killings, many defenders and communities also experience attempts to silence them, with tactics like death threats, surveillance, sexual violence, or criminalisation – and that these\nkinds of attacks are even less well reported. These challenges, coupled with the requirement to meet strict verification criteria for recording killings, mean that our figures are almost certainly an underestimate.\n\nHIGHEST COUNTRIES PER CAPITA\n1. Nicaragua\n2. Honduras\n3. Colombia\n4. Guatemala\n5. Philippines",

However, this occupation, while valid, can be substantially unjust and violate other laws (such as those protecting the fundamental rights to food and water, or to housing, or to the identity and culture of an indigenous people) because very often the legal framework justifying it does not respect all the rights at stake.\n\nSince militarily occupying a country is no longer accepted, it is better to occupy it 'economically.' And even better if we can legally extract the resources.\n\nAn indigenous community that occupies land collectively (and this is the typical way many indigenous communities manage spaces) or that has occupied it for centuries, almost never has the opportunity to demonstrate to have a property title. Also because the very concept of \"property\" is often unknown in these cultures, where the land belongs to everyone.\"",

        "desc": "Origins and Antiquity\nEarly Civilizations: Construction arose from the human need to create safe, controlled environments to protect against the elements. In Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations, local materials such as mud and stone were used to build monumental structures, such as temples and pyramids.\nGreece and Rome: These civilizations introduced technical innovations and concepts of harmonious proportion. The Romans, in particular, developed advanced techniques such as the construction of vaults and domes, creating imposing buildings such as the Colosseum.\nMiddle Ages and Renaissance\n\nMiddle Ages: Medieval construction saw a regression in techniques, with simpler yet more majestic constructions such as castles and cathedrals.\nRenaissance: Classical Greco-Roman architecture was rediscovered. Figures such as Brunelleschi and Alberti promoted the design of symmetrical and elegant buildings.\nThe Industrial Age and the 20th Century\nIndustrial Revolution: The introduction of new materials such as steel and reinforced concrete revolutionized construction possibilities, leading to the construction of innovative skyscrapers and bridges.\nRegulation in Italy: At the beginning of the 20th century, the lack of regulations led to uneven construction and an irrational use of land. The fundamental law of 1942 introduced urban planning tools (such as the master plan) and the requirement for building permits in major urban centers. The subsequent \"bridge law\" of 1967 extended the requirement for building permits to the entire country.",

        "desc": "Blood: \nRare but attested in medieval and Renaissance sources. It was sometimes used in small quantities in mortars or pigments, similar to animal blood.\nIt was believed to improve the cohesion and adhesion of materials or to have apotropaic (magical-protective) value.\nHistorical examples:\nSome late medieval chronicles describe human or animal blood being added to the mortar of defensive walls or foundations \"to give strength to the construction.\"\nIn some ritual cases, the use of human blood was symbolic or mythical, not technical (e.g., \"walls consecrated with the blood of prisoners\").\nTechnical value: Similar to animal blood (rich in coagulant proteins), but exceptionally used for obvious ethical and practical reasons.\n\nHair: \nFibrous reinforcement for mortars, plasters, and plasters.\nUse: Mixed with lime, gypsum, or clay to prevent cracking. From the Renaissance to the 19th century in Europe. Usually sourced from barber shops or household scraps.\nCommon alternative: horsehair or ox hair, which are longer and more durable.\n\nBones and Teeth:\nBurnt human bones (rich in phosphates and carbonates) were sometimes ground to obtain limestone powders or white pigments (bone white).\nBone ash could be used in some mortars or ceramic glazes.\nDissemination: Limited, but well documented in the decorative arts and primitive cements.\n\nUrine:\nIt contained ammonia and urea, therefore used as a cleaner, degreaser, or alkaline additive.\nIn construction, it was used to prepare pigments, treat metal surfaces, or soften lime.\nExamples:\nIn ancient Rome, urine was collected in fullonicae (laundries) for the processing of fabrics, but it was also used to clean marble surfaces and frescoes.\nIn some medieval contexts, it was mixed with lime or earth to increase plasticity.\n\nOther secondary human organic materials:\nSweat and fat:\nTraces present in hand-mixed clays, but not intentional additives.\nAsh from human remains: \nIn rare ritual cases, used symbolically for plaster or commemorative decorations.\nPlacenta or birth blood: \nMentioned only in magico-ritual texts or building folklore (not as an actual building practice).",

Human and horse hairs consider a bio material and have a good strong in tension; hence it can be used as a fiber reinforcement material. Hair Fiber (HE) an alternate non-degradable matter is available in abundance and at a very cheap cost. Iti also creates environmental problem for its decompositions. The aim of this research work is to find out the propertiles (mechanical) of hair fiber reinforced concrete. Experiments were conducted on concrete cylinders, cubes and prisms with various percentages of human and horse hairs fibers i.e. 0%, 19%, 1.5%, and 2.5 % by weight of cement. Two grades of reference plain concrete were used, 20 and 40 MPa: The results showed that there is an increment in the various mechanical properties and strength of concrete by addition of human and horse hairs to concrete.",

        "desc": "The main objective of this study was the application of a solution of human serum albumin as a granulating fluid. The properties of the granules formed were evaluated and compared with those when a conventional binder was applied in the same concentration. The powder mixture contained a soluble (mannitol) and an insoluble component (different types of cellulose). The protein solution applied exerted an appropriate aggregating effect if the system contained microcrystalline celluloses. Powdered cellulose was not suitable for the granulation with human serum albumin solution. As compared with the same concentration of the conventionally applied cellulose ethers as binder, the prepared granules exhibited a larger particle size, a significantly better compressibility, a higher breaking hardness and a favourable deformation process. These findings mainly reflect the good adhesive properties of the protein. The best compressibility and mechanical behaviour were attained on the application of the microcrystaline cellulose Vivapur type 105. This favourable behaviour may be connected with the wettability of cellulose. These results suggest that the formulation of tablets may be easier from an active agent in the serum that binds to albumin (le.g. interferon) since the amount of additives (binder) can be reduced.",

But if we position ourselves as the first, we can't already be a multinational → let's focus on the bodies and materials.\n\nA company that wants to build a dam comes to us only for the materials; for the construction, it turns to someone else.\n\n→ Building materials supplier?\n\nWe could rely on a demolition company, which demolitions and supplies us with materials. But we could do the same: we demolish and produce materials to build new infrastructure.\nLet's also think about the type of output that could be achieved: who are our clients? Other large companies and their clients?\nThe client chooses the characteristics of the materials and puts them in a specification, and then the company goes to the supplier, who supplies them.\nWe basically have a stock of bodies.\nBut being a construction materials company gives us less room for maneuver regarding output. Also because demolition is a very important part of our business (which, however, belongs to the construction company).\n",

For certain materials, especially finishes or visible elements, the client may approve samples or technical data sheets before purchase.\n\nThe contractor is responsible for selecting and procuring materials that meet the specified requirements. This includes assessing feasibility, optimizing costs and delivery times, managing purchasing and logistics, and ensuring that materials delivered to the site comply with the specifications. Together with the site supervisor, the contractor checks certifications and test reports to verify material conformity.\n\nThe supplier proposes materials that meet the project’s technical and regulatory criteria, offering technical support and ensuring quality. They provide all necessary documentation—such as CE marking and certificates of conformity—and guarantee timely delivery to the construction site.\n\n\n→ Client/Designer defines WHAT is needed (technical and aesthetic requirements, budget) = specifications.\n\n→ Company searches the market for WHO can provide that WHAT at the best price/service (selects suppliers) = quotes, orders.\n\n→ Supplier offers the WHAT and guarantees its quality = delivery with certifications.\n\n→ Project Manager/Company verifies on site that the materials are actually those agreed upon.\n",

Make it legal to kill local targets (i.e., people who live there and occupy the space, their homes, etc.).\n\nWhy isn't it plausible?

The project is therefore an emblematic case of \"expropriation for public utility\" on an epochal scale, which has radically and irreversibly altered the ecological and demographic balance of an entire region for energy and flood control purposes.\n",

SIAT is accused of acquiring the land to expand its plantations in a process that, according to complaints from NGOs and affected populations (including in Ghana and Nigeria), was conducted without due consultation or fair compensation. The consequences of this \"land theft\" include the loss of agricultural land vital to communities' livelihoods and food security, human rights violations, forced displacement, and severe environmental degradation due to intensive monocultures. Local communities, supported by organizations such as CIDSE and Focsiv, have forcefully demanded the restitution of their plots, compensation for the damages suffered, and the implementation of a transparent, rights-based dialogue process.\n",
