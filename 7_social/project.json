Try to explicitly state the film 'cameos' in the project as much as possible to make them immediately noticeable, so even make them too explicit or conversely use them as a reference and try to deviate; if we don't deviate too much, we need to think of an elegant way to clearly articulate this reference, keep somewhat the same narrative line; the risks of the first lie in the careful work on the references, but he still likes it very much, it just needs to be done in a refined way\n\n2 => meh, anyway, basically he likes it, here too the issue of references, here the main critical point to be careful of is the risk of it becoming a bit too silly, a bit an end in itself\n\nThe point is that it's important first and foremost to get people to think about social conflict, these scenarios are 'excuses' to talk about social conflict, which of the two conveys the message better? either by taking a radical stance or by remaining completely neutral, so I reason carefully about which of the two scenarios helps to convey the message better; perhaps the first tends to be more radical and the second less, what tone of voice do we want to maintain? what message do we want to convey about social conflict?",
