It takes on asymmetric, often invisible forms, embedded in cultural practices, social relations, and infrastructures. Its logic is not confined to violence: it also structures coexistence, shaping who holds privilege and who is pushed to the margins.\nExploring distributed conflicts means reading the present as a field where techniques of offense multiply and blur into the infrastructures society depends on. The goal is to generate critical devices, scenarios, and questions that probe the ambiguous nature of conflict as a diffuse condition in a post-territorial age.\n",

However, lacking official documents for this new identity, he discovers that his “freedom” is actually a prison.\n\nConsequences of missing documents:\n\t•\tLegal impossibilities: He cannot marry his love, Adriana, sign contracts, buy property, or defend himself in court. Bureaucracy becomes an impenetrable wall: without certificates, one is nobody.\n\t•\tSocial marginalization: He is seen as suspicious and unreliable, condemned to a perpetual kind of clandestinity.\n\t•\tParadox of anonymity: Initially, living without documents seems liberating, but it quickly becomes existentially distressing; he cannot fully participate in social life.\n\nEventually, Mattia must “die a second time” as Adriano Meis and return to his old identity as Mattia Pascal, but he is no longer recognized: his wife has remarried, and his past life has vanished. Trapped in a bureaucratic and identity limbo, he becomes literally “the late Mattia Pascal”: alive in reality, but dead on paper. Pirandello demonstrates how, in a bureaucratic society, the absence of documents, which might seem liberating, actually condemns a person to invisibility and helplessness.",

In The Trial, Josef K. is arrested for a crime whose charge is never revealed, forcing him to navigate an illogical, elusive judicial system, with his lawyer moving as slowly and opaquely as the process itself.\n\nImpersonal machine: Bureaucracy is portrayed as a system where cold rationality masks a world of complex, contradictory interests. Individuals like Josef K. become mere cogs, while officials and judges appear symbolic, almost inhuman, with incomprehensible, impersonal power.\n\nContradiction and totalitarian potential: Kafka foresaw bureaucracy’s tendency to become a totalitarian instrument, permeating citizens’ lives and minds. The system enforces conformity and submission to rules that seem to exist independently, suppressing personal freedom and subjectivity.",

In public offices, cases like Mafia Capitale (2014) and later investigations showed officials demanding money or favors to accelerate permits, tax procedures, or building licenses—otherwise delaying them for months or years. Similar schemes were uncovered in Lombardy and Sicily, where citizens were pressured to use “friendly” private firms to obtain approvals. In healthcare, reports by Transparency International and ISTAT revealed that around 2.4% of families were asked for money or favors to access faster medical services, while nearly 10% were encouraged by doctors to book private visits to bypass public waiting lists. These examples highlight how bureaucracy, when corrupted, becomes a tool of coercion that turns access to public rights into a matter of privilege.",

These lawsuits, often legally unfounded, aim to overwhelm defendants with the costs of legal defense, procedural delays, and the complexity of judicial processes. SLAPPs are effective because they exploit weaknesses in the judicial system, such as slow proceedings and prohibitive legal costs. The main goal is not to win the case but to pressure the defendant into giving up due to fear, exhaustion, or rising expenses, effectively silencing criticism. A recent high-profile example is the lawsuit filed by an oil and gas company against Greenpeace and several activists in North Dakota, which resulted in the company winning the case and Greenpeace being ordered to pay over $660 million in fines.",

Together, they outline a society in which life itself is managed with the impersonal efficiency of a factory, and human relationships are subjected to quality-control procedures. Hyper-bureaucratization thus emerges as the operational arm of biopower, using market logic to extend rational control to the farthest reaches of human experience.",
