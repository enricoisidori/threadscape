It is not limited to war or explicit clashes: it emerges within collective life as friction, as a continuous confrontation between competing needs, systems, and visions.\nIt is not a punctual episode but a latent and distributed condition. It takes on asymmetric, often invisible forms, embedded in cultural practices, social relations, and infrastructures. Its logic is not confined to violence: it also structures coexistence, shaping who holds privilege and who is pushed to the margins.\nExploring distributed conflicts means reading the present as a field where techniques of offense multiply and blur into the infrastructures society depends on. The goal is to generate critical devices, scenarios, and questions that probe the ambiguous nature of conflict as a diffuse condition in a post-territorial age.\n",

However, lacking official documents for this new identity, he discovers that his “freedom” is actually a prison.\n\nConsequences of missing documents:\n\t•\tLegal impossibilities: He cannot marry his love, Adriana, sign contracts, buy property, or defend himself in court. Bureaucracy becomes an impenetrable wall: without certificates, one is nobody.\n\t•\tSocial marginalization: He is seen as suspicious and unreliable, condemned to a perpetual kind of clandestinity.\n\t•\tParadox of anonymity: Initially, living without documents seems liberating, but it quickly becomes existentially distressing; he cannot fully participate in social life.\n\nEventually, Mattia must “die a second time” as Adriano Meis and return to his old identity as Mattia Pascal, but he is no longer recognized: his wife has remarried, and his past life has vanished. Trapped in a bureaucratic and identity limbo, he becomes literally “the late Mattia Pascal”: alive in reality, but dead on paper. Pirandello demonstrates how, in a bureaucratic society, the absence of documents, which might seem liberating, actually condemns a person to invisibility and helplessness.",
