It is not limited to war or explicit clashes: it emerges within collective life as friction, as a continuous confrontation between competing needs, systems, and visions.\nIt is not a punctual episode but a latent and distributed condition. It takes on asymmetric, often invisible forms, embedded in cultural practices, social relations, and infrastructures. Its logic is not confined to violence: it also structures coexistence, shaping who holds privilege and who is pushed to the margins.\nExploring distributed conflicts means reading the present as a field where techniques of offense multiply and blur into the infrastructures society depends on. The goal is to generate critical devices, scenarios, and questions that probe the ambiguous nature of conflict as a diffuse condition in a post-territorial age.\n",

        "desc": "Mark Fisher coined the term \"depressive hedonia\" to describe a modern paradox: people who obsessively seek pleasure but never get real satisfaction from it.\nConstant stimulation from the digital world overactivates our \"wanting\" system (dopamine) but makes our \"pleasure\" system (opioids) less sensitive. Result: we keep seeking rewards but never feel truly satisfied.\nThe mental conflict is frustrating: people understand that scrolling social media or consuming endless entertainment is pointless, but they can't stop. Fisher calls this \"powerless reflexivity\" - you know what you should do but remain trapped in behaviors that harm you.\nThis is a specific consequence of late capitalism that has created an environment of constant stimulation never seen before in human history, where seeking gratification becomes compulsive but never satisfying.",

But this makes us wonder: if suggestions can so easily get past our logical thinking, how much control do we really have over our daily decisions?",

        "desc": "In a world where voter interest is declining and turnout is at historic lows, who has truly shaped the system we live in—those who voted, or those who abstained?\nAbstaining and leaving decisions to the majority can be a symptom of decision fatigue. People are often unmotivated to inform themselves, showing little interest—even though the outcomes affect them on multiple levels.\nThis creates a cognitive conflict: political choices are complex, ambiguous, and full of imperfect alternatives. The inability to decide without discomfort leads to the simplest solution: not deciding at all. Abstention thus acts as a strategy to reduce cognitive noise.\nBut who really decided our system—the voters or the abstainers? And what if the tools meant to guide our choices—polls, surveys, tests—actually alienate us, flattening our critical and civic engagement?\nNon-choice is, in fact, a choice. Even if we believe that abstaining carries no consequences, it does—and it impacts both the system and those who abstain.",

The mind is thus forced to reconcile two irreconcilable poles: the pleasure derived from intense emotional stimulation and the moral awareness that this pleasure stems from the suffering of others.\nIt becomes imperative to show how the need to “feel something” is captured and exploited by the market of pain, prompting the audience to reflect on the human and ethical cost of turning others’ suffering into entertainment.",

The experience itself — how it unfolds and engages the participant — is what gives the project meaning.\n\nThe concept of the devil shift must be reframed as a cognitive conflict: who silences whom, and for what reason?\nThis shift helps us return to the human level of perception and agency.\nThe project’s strength lies in its storytelling — the ability to create resonance through familiar contexts, subtle narratives, and everyday situations that feel real but are carefully constructed.\n\nThe guiding principle is simplicity.\nThe experience should not be overcomplicated with layers of simulation or political overtones, but rather aim to provoke reflection and awareness through clarity, tension, and emotional engagement.",

Storytelling is key, with metaphors like natural filters (mussels or clams) illustrating the concept of filtering or controlling thoughts.\n\nUltimately, the scenario and narrative serve to define the branding and purpose: why would users want to turn off their thoughts, and what does the project reveal about human perception and behavior?",

The aesthetic requires a shift toward being less gentle to better convey an optimistic technological outlook that prioritizes functional emergence over other concerns. It's advisable to avoid the issue of comparative messaging altogether, rather than adopting a 'caring against noise' approach that risks conflating with genuine positive or wellbeing narratives. Furthermore, an excessive focus on the sea motif may inadvertently lead the brand discourse toward themes of sustainability. The graphic aspects of Sony's communication are highly effective in conveying their message and should be utilized as a direct source of inspiration and adaptation. Crucially, the core message regarding the discomfort of comparison must not be overlooked; the brand should clearly communicate that comparison is to be avoided. It is time to initiate the development of the technical component of the product narrative.",

To introduce provocation, two paths are suggested: either through the physical form of the product or through its function, leading to an unexpected or disturbing effect. The product should be designed to intentionally create a secondary problem. For instance, the sound function could be disruptive or generate an adverse reaction. This inherent provocation should be integrated into the product itself. The concept should be analyzed through the lens of extreme measures, such as the example of lobotomy (a practice used as the only way to suppress thoughts).",

Visual cues such as squeezing the temples should be explored.\n\nMaterial and visual dualities are effective: Chaos can be represented by opacity, while solitude can be represented by transparency. \n\nThe brand narrative should reference discussions on isolation and focus on the user's relational discomfort.\n\nFor communication, the focus should be on creating false pleasure. While avoiding a \"warm\" tone, a subtle degree of warmth is needed. \n\nCommunication Artifacts: Beyond essential social media and the website, develop a list of meaningful communication artifacts: fake related sub-products like home accessories, comfort elements for the home, collaborations, and items that speak about the brand without being the brand. Create a list of scenario elements leading to a categorized list of artifacts. The brand may decide to operate exclusively as an e-commerce platform.

The gentle and fluid imagery associated with the sea unintentionally steered the identity toward generalized concepts of sustainability and wellbeing, which risked conflating the product with unrelated narratives. Crucially, this soft visual direction failed to integrate the essential elements of technological optimism and the required sense of provocation. The aesthetic was deemed too passive and accommodating, lacking the necessary functional rigor and psychological edge required to effectively represent the product's core purpose: establishing a firm boundary against external comparison and discomfort. The visual language, therefore, did not support the required confidence and assertive functionality of the technology.",

Furthermore, as a wearable object, the earcuff introduced significant constraints related to durability and versatility for use by a diverse user base, which are critical considerations for any product developed at scale.

Consideration should be given to developing a bespoke font from scratch. The color lilac is ineffective, as it conveys a connotation of skincare. \n\nA potential design direction involves constructing letterforms based on frequency waves, requiring the study of shapes and potentially hand-drawing the typography. \n\nVisual identity and product development must proceed in parallel. The product design should feature interlocking elements, emphasizing the negative space (voids). The proposed construction involves fabric integrated with bone transducers and incorporating transparency to reveal internal components. The physical form should suggest a shell or armor, 3D-printed with varying textures. Alternatively, the shell concept should be abandoned in favor of a form that evokes the metallic texture seen in the posters, suggesting a lighter aesthetic. The product experience must be precisely defined, including the nature and recipient of the feedback. A storyboard is needed to detail the user journey and clarify the termination of the experience, potentially via a final audio message that communicates aggregated data (e.g., proximity/distancing statistics)",
