It is not limited to war or explicit clashes: it emerges within collective life as friction, as a continuous confrontation between competing needs, systems, and visions.\nIt is not a punctual episode but a latent and distributed condition. It takes on asymmetric, often invisible forms, embedded in cultural practices, social relations, and infrastructures. Its logic is not confined to violence: it also structures coexistence, shaping who holds privilege and who is pushed to the margins.\nExploring distributed conflicts means reading the present as a field where techniques of offense multiply and blur into the infrastructures society depends on. The goal is to generate critical devices, scenarios, and questions that probe the ambiguous nature of conflict as a diffuse condition in a post-territorial age.\n",

        "desc": "Mark Fisher coined the term \"depressive hedonia\" to describe a modern paradox: people who obsessively seek pleasure but never get real satisfaction from it.\nConstant stimulation from the digital world overactivates our \"wanting\" system (dopamine) but makes our \"pleasure\" system (opioids) less sensitive. Result: we keep seeking rewards but never feel truly satisfied.\nThe mental conflict is frustrating: people understand that scrolling social media or consuming endless entertainment is pointless, but they can't stop. Fisher calls this \"powerless reflexivity\" - you know what you should do but remain trapped in behaviors that harm you.\nThis is a specific consequence of late capitalism that has created an environment of constant stimulation never seen before in human history, where seeking gratification becomes compulsive but never satisfying.",

But this makes us wonder: if suggestions can so easily get past our logical thinking, how much control do we really have over our daily decisions?",

People are often unmotivated to inform themselves, showing little interest—even though the outcomes affect them on multiple levels.\nThis creates a cognitive conflict: political choices are complex, ambiguous, and full of imperfect alternatives. The inability to decide without discomfort leads to the simplest solution: not deciding at all. Abstention thus acts as a strategy to reduce cognitive noise.\nBut who really decided our system—the voters or the abstainers? And what if the tools meant to guide our choices—polls, surveys, tests—actually alienate us, flattening our critical and civic engagement?\nNon-choice is, in fact, a choice. Even if we believe that abstaining carries no consequences, it does—and it impacts both the system and those who abstain.",

The mind is thus forced to reconcile two irreconcilable poles: the pleasure derived from intense emotional stimulation and the moral awareness that this pleasure stems from the suffering of others.\nIt becomes imperative to show how the need to “feel something” is captured and exploited by the market of pain, prompting the audience to reflect on the human and ethical cost of turning others’ suffering into entertainment.",

The experience itself — how it unfolds and engages the participant — is what gives the project meaning.\n\nThe concept of the devil shift must be reframed as a cognitive conflict: who silences whom, and for what reason?\nThis shift helps us return to the human level of perception and agency.\nThe project’s strength lies in its storytelling — the ability to create resonance through familiar contexts, subtle narratives, and everyday situations that feel real but are carefully constructed.\n\nThe guiding principle is simplicity.\nThe experience should not be overcomplicated with layers of simulation or political overtones, but rather aim to provoke reflection and awareness through clarity, tension, and emotional engagement.",

Storytelling is key, with metaphors like natural filters (mussels or clams) illustrating the concept of filtering or controlling thoughts.\n\nUltimately, the scenario and narrative serve to define the branding and purpose: why would users want to turn off their thoughts, and what does the project reveal about human perception and behavior?",

The aesthetic requires a shift toward being less gentle to better convey an optimistic technological outlook that prioritizes functional emergence over other concerns. It's advisable to avoid the issue of comparative messaging altogether, rather than adopting a 'caring against noise' approach that risks conflating with genuine positive or wellbeing narratives. Furthermore, an excessive focus on the sea motif may inadvertently lead the brand discourse toward themes of sustainability. The graphic aspects of Sony's communication are highly effective in conveying their message and should be utilized as a direct source of inspiration and adaptation. Crucially, the core message regarding the discomfort of comparison must not be overlooked; the brand should clearly communicate that comparison is to be avoided. It is time to initiate the development of the technical component of the product narrative.",

This strategic shift is justified because, unlike the previous organic and shell-inspired themes, the Y2K-infused, technological aesthetic possesses the necessary assertiveness and synthetic confidence required to communicate the core disruptive message effectively.

While avoiding a \"warm\" tone, a subtle degree of warmth is needed. \n\nCommunication Artifacts: Beyond essential social media and the website, develop a list of meaningful communication artifacts: fake related sub-products like home accessories, comfort elements for the home, collaborations, and items that speak about the brand without being the brand. Create a list of scenario elements leading to a categorized list of artifacts. The brand may decide to operate exclusively as an e-commerce platform. The slogan \"better alone than in bad company\" is a viable concept.",

The color palette is dominated by blue and cyan, with deliberate accents of orange and neutral tones that, as evidenced by the image, evoke an artificial and futuristic luminosity. The visual identity is constructed through the repetition of distortion and blur effects, typical of the era, suggesting a digital transition, a hyper-real space (such as the perspective corridors), and a sensation of the ethereal, given the frequent presence of figures immersed in skies or bright environments. The adopted typography is intentionally linear and simple, a choice intended to contrast with the visual complexity of the luminous and reflective effects. Direct product references (such as the clear plastic headphones, attributable to a Sony aesthetic) and the presence of transparent surfaces reinforce the idea of a personal technology that transcends the physical object.\n\nThe e-den brand identity is characterized by a sleek, aseptic technological optimism. The name and its payoff, \"Paradise, untouched,\" suggest a state of curated, protected digital perfection. The logotype uses simple, rounded, lowercase typography with a clean, digital-era aesthetic, emphasizing accessibility and modernity. The visual campaign utilizes bright, airy backgrounds and a high-fidelity photographic style with subtle digital blurring. The core messaging, driven by statements such as \"Every mind deserves a firewall\" and the highly detached statement, \"She is safe. You aren't,\" frames the product as an indispensable, preemptive digital defense mechanism. This identity focuses on external threats and internal optimization, positioning the technology as a functional barrier against the chaotic influences of the outside world.",

        "desc": "The second identity explores a visual identity defined by rigorous structure and aseptic precision, utilizing highly controlled textures and materials. The aesthetic centers on the paradox of fragility within strength, combining clear biological references (such as shell structures and the visible mechanisms of the artificial heart) with refined, engineered elements. The visual language is dominated by a tight palette of whites, blacks, greys, suggesting clinical confidence and control, with minor accents of muted purple. Key textural components include embossing, subtle surface fracturing, and complex etched patterning, often applied to surfaces that evoke high-quality paper or precise engineered materials. The motif of transparency is central, employed to reveal internal mechanisms and structural layers. The focus remains on a highly refined, almost architectural presentation where structure and mechanism—rather than explicit ornamentation—convey the product's protective narrative.\n\nThe SHERU brand identity centers on the theme of biological and technological protection. The naming, derived from the phonetic transliteration of \"shell,\" is directly supported by the payoff, \"Protecting you from reality.\" The logo utilizes a layered, armored graphic—a stylized shell or visor—that communicates containment and focused observation. The visual campaign is characterized by high contrast and a slightly aged texture, employing the strong, literal imagery of a Nautilus shell spiral integrated into a complex headpiece. The messaging, highlighted by phrases such as \"safest when you're alone\" and \"a shell for the modern mind,\" conveys a tone of deep, internal refuge, positioning the product as an essential biological-technological armor for the modern psychological self.",

These campaigns consistently employ unsettling, direct rhetorical questions and adversarial messaging (e.g., \"Who said you have to come out of your shell?\") to position isolation as the only sensible solution for mental security. The visual execution explores several key metaphors, ranging from the abstract representation of cognitive structures (topographical lines and patterns) and the primal symbolism of containment and retreat (the Nautilus shell motif), to the raw, visceral display of human discomfort and the pain of intrusion.
