It is not limited to war or explicit clashes: it emerges within collective life as friction, as a continuous confrontation between competing needs, systems, and visions.\nIt is not a punctual episode but a latent and distributed condition. It takes on asymmetric, often invisible forms, embedded in cultural practices, social relations, and infrastructures. Its logic is not confined to violence: it also structures coexistence, shaping who holds privilege and who is pushed to the margins.\nExploring distributed conflicts means reading the present as a field where techniques of offense multiply and blur into the infrastructures society depends on. The goal is to generate critical devices, scenarios, and questions that probe the ambiguous nature of conflict as a diffuse condition in a post-territorial age.\n",

        "desc": "Mark Fisher coined the term \"depressive hedonia\" to describe a modern paradox: people who obsessively seek pleasure but never get real satisfaction from it.\nConstant stimulation from the digital world overactivates our \"wanting\" system (dopamine) but makes our \"pleasure\" system (opioids) less sensitive. Result: we keep seeking rewards but never feel truly satisfied.\nThe mental conflict is frustrating: people understand that scrolling social media or consuming endless entertainment is pointless, but they can't stop. Fisher calls this \"powerless reflexivity\" - you know what you should do but remain trapped in behaviors that harm you.\nThis is a specific consequence of late capitalism that has created an environment of constant stimulation never seen before in human history, where seeking gratification becomes compulsive but never satisfying.",

But this makes us wonder: if suggestions can so easily get past our logical thinking, how much control do we really have over our daily decisions?",

        "desc": "In a world where voter interest is declining and turnout is at historic lows, who has truly shaped the system we live in—those who voted, or those who abstained?\nAbstaining and leaving decisions to the majority can be a symptom of decision fatigue. People are often unmotivated to inform themselves, showing little interest—even though the outcomes affect them on multiple levels.\nThis creates a cognitive conflict: political choices are complex, ambiguous, and full of imperfect alternatives. The inability to decide without discomfort leads to the simplest solution: not deciding at all. Abstention thus acts as a strategy to reduce cognitive noise.\nBut who really decided our system—the voters or the abstainers? And what if the tools meant to guide our choices—polls, surveys, tests—actually alienate us, flattening our critical and civic engagement?\nNon-choice is, in fact, a choice. Even if we believe that abstaining carries no consequences, it does—and it impacts both the system and those who abstain.",

The mind is thus forced to reconcile two irreconcilable poles: the pleasure derived from intense emotional stimulation and the moral awareness that this pleasure stems from the suffering of others.\nIt becomes imperative to show how the need to “feel something” is captured and exploited by the market of pain, prompting the audience to reflect on the human and ethical cost of turning others’ suffering into entertainment.",

The experience itself — how it unfolds and engages the participant — is what gives the project meaning.\n\nThe concept of the devil shift must be reframed as a cognitive conflict: who silences whom, and for what reason?\nThis shift helps us return to the human level of perception and agency.\nThe project’s strength lies in its storytelling — the ability to create resonance through familiar contexts, subtle narratives, and everyday situations that feel real but are carefully constructed.\n\nThe guiding principle is simplicity.\nThe experience should not be overcomplicated with layers of simulation or political overtones, but rather aim to provoke reflection and awareness through clarity, tension, and emotional engagement.",

Storytelling is key, with metaphors like natural filters (mussels or clams) illustrating the concept of filtering or controlling thoughts.\n\nUltimately, the scenario and narrative serve to define the branding and purpose: why would users want to turn off their thoughts, and what does the project reveal about human perception and behavior?",
