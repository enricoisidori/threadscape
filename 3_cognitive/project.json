It is not limited to war or explicit clashes: it emerges within collective life as friction, as a continuous confrontation between competing needs, systems, and visions.\nIt is not a punctual episode but a latent and distributed condition. It takes on asymmetric, often invisible forms, embedded in cultural practices, social relations, and infrastructures. Its logic is not confined to violence: it also structures coexistence, shaping who holds privilege and who is pushed to the margins.\nExploring distributed conflicts means reading the present as a field where techniques of offense multiply and blur into the infrastructures society depends on. The goal is to generate critical devices, scenarios, and questions that probe the ambiguous nature of conflict as a diffuse condition in a post-territorial age.\n",

        "desc": "Mark Fisher coined the term \"depressive hedonia\" to describe a modern paradox: people who obsessively seek pleasure but never get real satisfaction from it.\nConstant stimulation from the digital world overactivates our \"wanting\" system (dopamine) but makes our \"pleasure\" system (opioids) less sensitive. Result: we keep seeking rewards but never feel truly satisfied.\nThe mental conflict is frustrating: people understand that scrolling social media or consuming endless entertainment is pointless, but they can't stop. Fisher calls this \"powerless reflexivity\" - you know what you should do but remain trapped in behaviors that harm you.\nThis is a specific consequence of late capitalism that has created an environment of constant stimulation never seen before in human history, where seeking gratification becomes compulsive but never satisfying.",

But this makes us wonder: if suggestions can so easily get past our logical thinking, how much control do we really have over our daily decisions?",

        "desc": "In a world where voter interest is declining and turnout is at historic lows, who has truly shaped the system we live in—those who voted, or those who abstained?\nAbstaining and leaving decisions to the majority can be a symptom of decision fatigue. People are often unmotivated to inform themselves, showing little interest—even though the outcomes affect them on multiple levels.\nThis creates a cognitive conflict: political choices are complex, ambiguous, and full of imperfect alternatives. The inability to decide without discomfort leads to the simplest solution: not deciding at all. Abstention thus acts as a strategy to reduce cognitive noise.\nBut who really decided our system—the voters or the abstainers? And what if the tools meant to guide our choices—polls, surveys, tests—actually alienate us, flattening our critical and civic engagement?\nNon-choice is, in fact, a choice. Even if we believe that abstaining carries no consequences, it does—and it impacts both the system and those who abstain.",

The mind is thus forced to reconcile two irreconcilable poles: the pleasure derived from intense emotional stimulation and the moral awareness that this pleasure stems from the suffering of others.\nIt becomes imperative to show how the need to “feel something” is captured and exploited by the market of pain, prompting the audience to reflect on the human and ethical cost of turning others’ suffering into entertainment.",

The experience itself — how it unfolds and engages the participant — is what gives the project meaning.\n\nThe concept of the devil shift must be reframed as a cognitive conflict: who silences whom, and for what reason?\nThis shift helps us return to the human level of perception and agency.\nThe project’s strength lies in its storytelling — the ability to create resonance through familiar contexts, subtle narratives, and everyday situations that feel real but are carefully constructed.\n\nThe guiding principle is simplicity.\nThe experience should not be overcomplicated with layers of simulation or political overtones, but rather aim to provoke reflection and awareness through clarity, tension, and emotional engagement.",

Storytelling is key, with metaphors like natural filters (mussels or clams) illustrating the concept of filtering or controlling thoughts.\n\nUltimately, the scenario and narrative serve to define the branding and purpose: why would users want to turn off their thoughts, and what does the project reveal about human perception and behavior?",

The aesthetic requires a shift toward being less gentle to better convey an optimistic technological outlook that prioritizes functional emergence over other concerns. It's advisable to avoid the issue of comparative messaging altogether, rather than adopting a 'caring against noise' approach that risks conflating with genuine positive or wellbeing narratives. Furthermore, an excessive focus on the sea motif may inadvertently lead the brand discourse toward themes of sustainability. The graphic aspects of Sony's communication are highly effective in conveying their message and should be utilized as a direct source of inspiration and adaptation. Crucially, the core message regarding the discomfort of comparison must not be overlooked; the brand should clearly communicate that comparison is to be avoided. It is time to initiate the development of the technical component of the product narrative.",

This strategic shift is justified because, unlike the previous organic and shell-inspired themes, the Y2K-infused, technological aesthetic possesses the necessary assertiveness and synthetic confidence required to communicate the core disruptive message effectively.

In this concept, the shell motif is utilized solely as an internal, non-explicit structure.\nConcurrently, initial functional development has progressed with the first stages of Arduino programming.",

Pros and cons for each manufacturing method were rigorously weighed:\n\nThermoforming was considered for its potential to produce large, transparent, and uniform shells efficiently, but it was noted to lack the capacity for highly complex geometries.\n\n3D printing offered superior design complexity, quicker iteration, and easier integration of internal fixtures, but presented challenges regarding the final surface finish, the difficulty of achieving perfect transparency on a large scale, and the potential for increased material costs for a structure of that size.",

The physical product, a biotech-inspired training device (the cylinder/band), functions effectively by teaching social repulsion via conditioned sound reflexes, directly translating the philosophy into an active user experience. The overall system functions because the visual identity—characterized by aseptic coldness, Swiss Style rigor, and metallic transparency—perfectly mirrors this cold, calculated functional purpose, ensuring that the design's strict logic validates the logic of aggressive detachment.

This choice is deemed the most sensible as the helmet provides the necessary physical dimension and communicative power to effectively embody the core concept of provocative isolation and complete external shielding. Its scale allows for the literal interpretation of a protective shell or armor, which is crucial for conveying the brand's assertive message against confrontation, unlike the more passive communication offered by smaller wearable accessories.",

The visuals maintain an aseptic, high-contrast rigor, using embossed textures and blurred, plastic-like imagery to heighten tension. The messaging relies on unsettling, confrontational questions to present isolation as the only rational form of mental security. Metaphors range from abstract cognitive maps to primal symbols of retreat, like the Nautilus shell, and even visceral depictions of human discomfort. This multifaceted approach aggressively promotes self-protection, though it still risks missing the core conflict at the heart of the concept.",
