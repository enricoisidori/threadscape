It is not limited to war or explicit clashes: it emerges within collective life as friction, as a continuous confrontation between competing needs, systems, and visions.\nIt is not a punctual episode but a latent and distributed condition. It takes on asymmetric, often invisible forms, embedded in cultural practices, social relations, and infrastructures. Its logic is not confined to violence: it also structures coexistence, shaping who holds privilege and who is pushed to the margins.\nExploring distributed conflicts means reading the present as a field where techniques of offense multiply and blur into the infrastructures society depends on. The goal is to generate critical devices, scenarios, and questions that probe the ambiguous nature of conflict as a diffuse condition in a post-territorial age.\n",
