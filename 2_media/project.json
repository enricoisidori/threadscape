It is not limited to war or explicit clashes: it emerges within collective life as friction, as a continuous confrontation between competing needs, systems, and visions.\nIt is not a punctual episode but a latent and distributed condition. It takes on asymmetric, often invisible forms, embedded in cultural practices, social relations, and infrastructures. Its logic is not confined to violence: it also structures coexistence, shaping who holds privilege and who is pushed to the margins.\nExploring distributed conflicts means reading the present as a field where techniques of offense multiply and blur into the infrastructures society depends on. The goal is to generate critical devices, scenarios, and questions that probe the ambiguous nature of conflict as a diffuse condition in a post-territorial age.\n",

It is not only physical confrontation but also a struggle over how reality is interpreted. \nMediatic, from “media” (means of communication), points to what is spread and amplified through press, TV, radio, social networks, and digital platforms: information is always filtered by formats, interests, and algorithms. \nMediatic conflict thus means a clash occurring through media (propaganda, narrative wars, manipulation) or one fueled by them, amplifying existing tensions",

In fact, we actively seek and demand such content: the more a message provokes outrage, the more it is shared, boosting engagement and, in turn, the profits of platforms and news outlets that spread it.",

Today, similar dynamics appear in hatred toward immigrants, described by media in certain contexts as invaders or security threats, and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where Israeli government narratives dehumanize Palestinians, facilitating genocide. In all cases, media filters shape minds by creating false narratives that fuel conflict, pushing people to hate not what others truly are, but what they've been led to believe they are.",

The same applies to our daily exchanges: a message corrected by ChatGPT, news written by software and already processed before reaching us, an image built by a model instead of a photographer, an entire YouTube video generated and dubbed by AI. The paradox is that even human-born content passes through algorithmic filters. Every message, opinion, image risks being translated and reformulated by machines, dissolving communication's authenticity. Thus media's original promise – human-to-human communication – empties: our exchanges no longer happen directly, but within simulated space where machines talk to machines and humans remain passive spectators.",

It is as if we were on an island where the rules of human coexistence no longer apply, returning to a kind of tribal state. But is it this place that corrupts us, or something already within us? There are no laws or consequences; we hide behind nicknames and no longer perceive others as real people — we don’t see them, we don’t hear them, they are no longer human to us.\n- Issue:  \nIn the digital context, we observe more aggressive and conflictual behavior. But where does the root of this problem lie? Is it a lack of social rules? A lack of human contact and perception of others? Inner frustration seeking an outlet? Or a lack of digital empathy?\n- Definition and cause of the conflict:  \nConflict occurs between two or more online users. In digital spaces, the perception of the other becomes distorted because we are not physically present: there is no face, no voice, no body. As a result, we push our tone further, often becoming aggressive and losing all sense of empathy.",

News outlets, digital platforms, and social media constantly compete for attention in a system driven by speed and excess. Our brains, predisposed to the negativity bias — the tendency to notice and remember negative events more than positive ones — are continuously exposed to stories of conflict, crisis, and catastrophe.  This tendency is reinforced by market logic and algorithms: negative content generates more clicks, interactions, and shares, and is therefore prioritized. Studies show that every additional negative word in a headline increases its click-through rate by about 2.3%, while positive words reduce it. News with negative language is shared nearly twice as often as neutral or positive ones, and those who consume more negative content experience a measurable decline in mood and well-being. Negativity is thus not favored because it is truer, but because it is more “profitable” in terms of attention, creating a growing gap between real complexity and the dark, distorted image of the world we receive.\n- Issue and conflict:  \nWhat kind of relationship with reality are we building when information feeds primarily on negativity? The conflict lies between real and perceived reality: the more the media amplify the negative, the more we perceive the world as dangerous and unstable. This leads to emotional numbness and anxiety, producing a paradoxical dependence — the more negative the news, the more we crave it. Media and platforms sustain this cycle, shaping collective sensitivity around fear and distress.",

Social networks amplified the discontent: hashtags like #GiustiziaNegata and #ProcessoAlSistema filled digital squares as people demanded transparency and participation. Trust shifted from courts to online communities and collaborative platforms, where collective judgment became a habit.\nIn 2028, the “Ferreri case” — a wrongful conviction later overturned by digital evidence — caused the system to collapse. Mass protests led to the first open debate on radical judicial reform.\nIn 2030, the government launched a national call for proposals to create a new institutional model: a Media Court, where every citizen can vote on selected cases through a state platform. A specialized civic tech agency was commissioned to design and build this new participatory justice system.",

Decades of errors and over 30,000 wrongful detentions have eroded trust, with less than half of Italians believing in the judiciary. Out of this crisis emerges X, a movement demanding a new, people-driven form of justice. Their digital platform, AGORA, turns trials into public events: evidence is uploaded, debates streamed, verdicts decided by mass vote. Supporters call it “the people’s justice”—fast, transparent, democratic—guided by the “wisdom of the crowd.” Critics warn it’s mob rule, not reform. In Milan’s Piazza Duomo, AGORA’s first presentation stirs both euphoria and fear. As millions prepare to judge from their screens, one question divides the nation: is this the birth of true justice—or its digital demise?",

It creates belonging, drives engagement, and mirrors a form of propaganda where non-professionalism becomes a right, and every homemade banner is also a political statement. The message is clear: anyone can communicate, anyone can join, anyone can do politics.\nThis aesthetic stems from a widespread distrust toward any form of authority — intellectual (the professors), technical (the economists, Monti, etc.), or institutional.\nWhere Berlusconi sold an elsewhere — the “where you’d like to be” of the Italian dream — and the Left insisted on “we know where you should be,” the Five Star Movement shifted sideways: no new world to imagine, because the existing one is already perfect. It’s them — the elites, the experts, the professionals — who ruined it. What we will build, even if pixelated and noisy, will still be ours.",

Conversely, someone falsely accused may opt for the traditional court, where only verified proof counts and opinions have no place.\n→ The conflict lies in the different outcomes depending on the chosen system.\n--------\nModel B — Integrated / Fused System\nThe trial becomes a single public event managed by both the State and the platform.\nThe first level of judgment is the “media verdict,” which could solve the issue of speed by avoiding long legal procedures.\nFor example, if someone is accused, the public first votes. If the majority agrees with the outcome, the case closes quickly; otherwise, it proceeds to a traditional trial.\n→ Conflict: speed and engagement vs. precision and scrutiny.\n",

Between 1991 and 2024, 31,949 wrongful convictions cost nearly one billion euros, symbolizing a slow, opaque, and distant system. Media scandals and social networks amplified discontent, with hashtags like #BetrayedTruth spreading, shifting trust from courts to online communities.\nThe breaking point came in 2028 with the Langhirano case: Donatello Dariani, imprisoned for years, was innocent. Public outrage sparked debates on radically reforming justice.\nIn 2029, inspired by the “wisdom of the crowd,” the government approved a national popular jury pilot, letting citizens vote on selected cases. By 2030, a public tender invited companies and research centers to design a participatory justice system, defining both its rules and operations, blending public engagement with legal oversight.\n",
