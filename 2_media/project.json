It is not limited to war or explicit clashes: it emerges within collective life as friction, as a continuous confrontation between competing needs, systems, and visions.\nIt is not a punctual episode but a latent and distributed condition. It takes on asymmetric, often invisible forms, embedded in cultural practices, social relations, and infrastructures. Its logic is not confined to violence: it also structures coexistence, shaping who holds privilege and who is pushed to the margins.\nExploring distributed conflicts means reading the present as a field where techniques of offense multiply and blur into the infrastructures society depends on. The goal is to generate critical devices, scenarios, and questions that probe the ambiguous nature of conflict as a diffuse condition in a post-territorial age.\n",

This information overload (often superficial, distorted, or misleading) has devalued truth, making it harder to distinguish from falsehood. \nPeople increasingly rely on cognitive shortcuts, accepting simple or confirming news without verification. The result is a society of “parallel truths,” where objective truth loses significance.

Today, similar dynamics appear in hatred toward immigrants, described by media in certain contexts as invaders or security threats, and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where Israeli government narratives dehumanize Palestinians, facilitating genocide. In all cases, media filters shape minds by creating false narratives that fuel conflict, pushing people to hate not what others truly are, but what they've been led to believe they are.",

The same applies to our daily exchanges: a message corrected by ChatGPT, news written by software and already processed before reaching us, an image built by a model instead of a photographer, an entire YouTube video generated and dubbed by AI. The paradox is that even human-born content passes through algorithmic filters. Every message, opinion, image risks being translated and reformulated by machines, dissolving communication's authenticity. Thus media's original promise – human-to-human communication – empties: our exchanges no longer happen directly, but within simulated space where machines talk to machines and humans remain passive spectators.",

News outlets, digital platforms, and social media constantly compete for attention in a system driven by speed and excess. Our brains, predisposed to the negativity bias — the tendency to notice and remember negative events more than positive ones — are continuously exposed to stories of conflict, crisis, and catastrophe.  This tendency is reinforced by market logic and algorithms: negative content generates more clicks, interactions, and shares, and is therefore prioritized. Studies show that every additional negative word in a headline increases its click-through rate by about 2.3%, while positive words reduce it. News with negative language is shared nearly twice as often as neutral or positive ones, and those who consume more negative content experience a measurable decline in mood and well-being. Negativity is thus not favored because it is truer, but because it is more “profitable” in terms of attention, creating a growing gap between real complexity and the dark, distorted image of the world we receive.\n- Issue and conflict:  \nWhat kind of relationship with reality are we building when information feeds primarily on negativity? The conflict lies between real and perceived reality: the more the media amplify the negative, the more we perceive the world as dangerous and unstable. This leads to emotional numbness and anxiety, producing a paradoxical dependence — the more negative the news, the more we crave it. Media and platforms sustain this cycle, shaping collective sensitivity around fear and distress.",

Judicial errors and wrongful detentions, which between 1991 and 2024 totaled 31,949 cases and nearly one billion euros in compensation, became the symbol of a system seen as slow, opaque, and distant from citizens.\nMedia scandals and investigations exposed a system more concerned with appearances than truth. Social networks amplified the discontent: hashtags like #GiustiziaNegata and #ProcessoAlSistema filled digital squares as people demanded transparency and participation. Trust shifted from courts to online communities and collaborative platforms, where collective judgment became a habit.\nIn 2028, the “Ferreri case” — a wrongful conviction later overturned by digital evidence — caused the system to collapse. Mass protests led to the first open debate on radical judicial reform.\nIn 2030, the government launched a national call for proposals to create a new institutional model: a Media Court, where every citizen can vote on selected cases through a state platform. A specialized civic tech agency was commissioned to design and build this new participatory justice system.",

Decades of errors and over 30,000 wrongful detentions have eroded trust, with less than half of Italians believing in the judiciary. Out of this crisis emerges X, a movement demanding a new, people-driven form of justice. Their digital platform, AGORA, turns trials into public events: evidence is uploaded, debates streamed, verdicts decided by mass vote. Supporters call it “the people’s justice”—fast, transparent, democratic—guided by the “wisdom of the crowd.” Critics warn it’s mob rule, not reform. In Milan’s Piazza Duomo, AGORA’s first presentation stirs both euphoria and fear. As millions prepare to judge from their screens, one question divides the nation: is this the birth of true justice—or its digital demise?",

It creates belonging, drives engagement, and mirrors a form of propaganda where non-professionalism becomes a right, and every homemade banner is also a political statement. The message is clear: anyone can communicate, anyone can join, anyone can do politics.\nThis aesthetic stems from a widespread distrust toward any form of authority — intellectual (the professors), technical (the economists, Monti, etc.), or institutional.\nWhere Berlusconi sold an elsewhere — the “where you’d like to be” of the Italian dream — and the Left insisted on “we know where you should be,” the Five Star Movement shifted sideways: no new world to imagine, because the existing one is already perfect. It’s them — the elites, the experts, the professionals — who ruined it. What we will build, even if pixelated and noisy, will still be ours.",

Between 1991 and 2024, 31,949 wrongful convictions cost nearly one billion euros, symbolizing a slow, opaque, and distant system. Media scandals and social networks amplified discontent, with hashtags like #BetrayedTruth spreading, shifting trust from courts to online communities.\nThe breaking point came in 2028 with the Langhirano case: Donatello Dariani, imprisoned for years, was innocent. Public outrage sparked debates on radically reforming justice.\nIn 2029, inspired by the “wisdom of the crowd,” the government approved a national popular jury pilot, letting citizens vote on selected cases. By 2030, a public tender invited companies and research centers to design a participatory justice system, defining both its rules and operations, blending public engagement with legal oversight.\n",

It directly connects to the historical roots of democratic participation while sounding contemporary and memorable. It also plays on today’s idea of social exclusion, linked to media-driven justice. \nThe aesthetic uses simplified triangular patterns inspired by ceramic fragments, primitive icon-like signs, and a palette mixing bright and muted tones. \nThe platform adopts a clean, modern look based on these triangles, with a vivid blue–orange contrast echoing the two voting factions. \nThe communication machine is a digital totem for voting: a top screen shows the case summary and voting trends, two central windows display symbolic shards—orange for guilty, blue for innocent—and a triangular slot at the bottom allows users to cast their vote by dropping the chosen shard.",

The cardboard prototype became a fundamental step in translating the concept into a tangible form and guided the next phases of design refinement.",

Since we did not want to mix different materials between the body and the base, we chose to make the entire object using the same 3D printing process. After creating the 3D models, we tested the printing of both the base and the body. While the base was successful, the body presented several issues. To solve them, we decided to divide the body into four separate parts, making the printing process more reliable and manageable.",

We chose this card as the final takeaway of the voting experience: it serves as a certificate of the user’s vote, displaying the accused’s photo, name, case title, and the chosen verdict.",

No vertical lines.\n- Color palette: consistent across all outputs.\n- Underlines: especially for white text on black backgrounds, but also red and blue for emphasis.\n- Fonts: Zuume and IBM Plex Serif.\n- Cut-out figures: for all accused characters.\nThese guidelines define the visual language of U-Judge, allowing us to replicate its style across different media while maintaining coherence.",

Here, they can watch the teaser and the trailer, download the application, and begin to learn about the \"case of the week\". This area also includes the editorial product that synthesizes and explains the entire project.\n- The second zone represents the actual voting moment. In this space, a computer equipped with headphones allows visitors to watch the recap video from the “innocent” or “guilty” perspective, or both. Next to it, a dedicated machine enables them to cast their vote, choosing between guilty or innocent.",
