It is not limited to war or explicit clashes: it emerges within collective life as friction, as a continuous confrontation between competing needs, systems, and visions.\nIt is not a punctual episode but a latent and distributed condition. It takes on asymmetric, often invisible forms, embedded in cultural practices, social relations, and infrastructures. Its logic is not confined to violence: it also structures coexistence, shaping who holds privilege and who is pushed to the margins.\nExploring distributed conflicts means reading the present as a field where techniques of offense multiply and blur into the infrastructures society depends on. The goal is to generate critical devices, scenarios, and questions that probe the ambiguous nature of conflict as a diffuse condition in a post-territorial age.\n",

This information overload (often superficial, distorted, or misleading) has devalued truth, making it harder to distinguish from falsehood. \nPeople increasingly rely on cognitive shortcuts, accepting simple or confirming news without verification. The result is a society of “parallel truths,” where objective truth loses significance. Yet truth remains essential: without it, civil coexistence, public debate, and democracy rest on fragile ground.",

In Nazism, propaganda portrayed Jews as a dehumanized threat, fueling antisemitism until it became socially acceptable and functional to violence. Today, similar dynamics appear in hatred toward immigrants, described by media in certain contexts as invaders or security threats, and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where Israeli government narratives dehumanize Palestinians, facilitating genocide. In all cases, media filters shape minds by creating false narratives that fuel conflict, pushing people to hate not what others truly are, but what they've been led to believe they are.",

Ranking algorithms determine what appears in feeds, chatbots and generative AI produce texts, images and videos instead of us, synthesis systems like Google AI Overview reformulate what we search without letting us explore deeper. The same applies to our daily exchanges: a message corrected by ChatGPT, news written by software and already processed before reaching us, an image built by a model instead of a photographer, an entire YouTube video generated and dubbed by AI. The paradox is that even human-born content passes through algorithmic filters. Every message, opinion, image risks being translated and reformulated by machines, dissolving communication's authenticity. Thus media's original promise – human-to-human communication – empties: our exchanges no longer happen directly, but within simulated space where machines talk to machines and humans remain passive spectators.",
