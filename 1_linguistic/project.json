It is not limited to war or explicit clashes: it emerges within collective life as friction, as a continuous confrontation between competing needs, systems, and visions.\nIt is not a punctual episode but a latent and distributed condition. It takes on asymmetric, often invisible forms, embedded in cultural practices, social relations, and infrastructures. Its logic is not confined to violence: it also structures coexistence, shaping who holds privilege and who is pushed to the margins.\nExploring distributed conflicts means reading the present as a field where techniques of offense multiply and blur into the infrastructures society depends on. The goal is to generate critical devices, scenarios, and questions that probe the ambiguous nature of conflict as a diffuse condition in a post-territorial age.",

A language is therefore a system of communication composed of various subsystems. The principal components of a language include the lexicon, the phonological system, morphology, syntax, and pragmatics; when both spoken and written forms are present, a writing system must also be considered.\nLinguistics is the discipline devoted to the study of languages, with the aim of understanding the uniquely human capacity for language. Ferdinand de Saussure was the first scholar to endow linguistics with empirical methods and with the scientific objectivity characteristic of the natural sciences. His theories, later collected under the designation of structuralism, earned him recognition by many as the founding figure of modern linguistics.",

They perceive the world in geographic rather than egocentric terms.\nPirahã (Amazon, Brazil)\nThey lack precise numbers; only the concepts of “few” and “many” exist.\nThis alters the perception of quantity itself: for them, there is no “seven fish,” only “some fish.” They live in an immediate present, without the mathematical abstraction as understood in Western cultures.\nYupik (Inuit populations of Alaska)\nThey have over 90 terms for snow, not merely as a substance but as an event, process, or outcome.\nFor example, there are distinct words for “snow falling in large flakes,” “freshly fallen soft snow,” and “snow compacted by wind.” This is not simple synonymy but a perceptual mapping of the landscape, which is vital for them.\nDani (Papua New Guinea)\nThey have only two words for colors: “mili” (dark, cool: black, blue, green) and “mola” (light, warm: red, yellow, white).\nThey do not distinguish blue from green or yellow from white, because the chromatic world is reduced to two categories. Color is thus perceived as polarity rather than as a spectrum.\nAymara (Andes, Bolivia/Peru)\nTheir perception of time is inverted:\nPast = in front (visible)\nFuture = behind (not visible)\nFor them, the future comes from behind the back, and the past lies before the eyes—a true reversal of our mental image of time.\nBassa (Liberia, Africa)\nThe language lacks words for numbers beyond five; quantities above this are expressed through combinations and metaphors.\nThis lexical limitation results in a very different perception of quantity: mathematics is not an innate tool in their worldview.\nKalaallisut (Greenland, Inuit)\nSingle word: “qangatasuukkuvimmuuriaqalaaqtunga” = “I have to go to the airport.”\nThe language is polysynthetic: a concept that requires an entire sentence in Italian is expressed as a single word.

        "desc": "Definition\nIn contemporary society, technology is taking on an increasingly important role, to the point where its application is being considered even in areas traditionally tied to human beings, such as psychotherapy.\nPsychotherapy\nIn the near future, could machines replace the role of the psychotherapist?\nEven today, there are chatbots and apps that provide psychological support, but the complete replacement of a human therapist would raise profound questions.\nThe problem: we do not speak the same language. A chatbot cannot fully understand us or replace a psychotherapist, especially because a machine tends to produce standardized, algorithmic language.\nHuman communication, on the other hand, is rich in nuances: pauses, metaphors, hesitations, slips, ambiguities — all of which the therapist interprets as valuable signals.\nParalanguage\nParalanguage is the set of non-verbal vocal elements that accompany words. It does not concern what we say, but how we say it:\nTone of voice\nVolume\nIntonation\nRhythm and speed\nPauses and silences\nExtralinguistic sounds → sighs, laughter, throat clearing, murmurs.\nFunctions of paralanguage\nEmotional → expresses feelings.\nRelational → strengthens or weakens the relationship with the interlocutor (welcoming vs. detached tone).\nInterpretive → gives meaning to words (a “thank you” can be sincere or ironic depending on tone).\nParalanguage in psychotherapy\nIn the context of psychotherapy, paralanguage plays an enormous role:\nthe therapist perceives anxiety, discomfort, hesitation from the patient’s rhythm and pauses;\nthe therapist’s tone of voice can convey warmth, calm, empathy;\nsilences and sighs become an integral part of the relationship.\nFor this reason, it is very difficult for a machine to replace a psychotherapist: AI can process words, but it struggles to interpret (or reproduce) paralinguistic nuances with authenticity.\nThe heart of the conflict\nOn one side, human language: alive, emotional, relational.\nOn the other, artificial language: neutral, calculated, impersonal.\nThis conflict would also affect the language of care: what will it mean to “speak with the therapist” if the interlocutor is an algorithm? Can we truly call the machine’s response “listening”? In this sense, the issue is not only technological but also cultural and linguistic: it concerns the value we assign to language as a tool for authentic human connection.",

Newspapers carry headlines like “An unfortunate encounter” or “An unexpected episode,” while the real perpetrators vanish from the sentences. The subject of the action disappears; all that remains is “something that happened” to the victim. In everyday language, rape and sex blend indistinguishably into a single lexical field, and the gravity of the act becomes difficult to grasp.\nThe heart of the conflict emerges in daily conversations: those who attempt to name the violence are met with discomfort, as if they had broken an invisible rule, while those who remain silent do so to protect sensibilities, institutions, reputations. Words turn into a silent battleground, and reality itself bends to language: what is left unsaid loses weight, while what is hidden continues to exist — invisible yet present, like a shadow that everyone senses but no one dares to call by name.",

Abbreviated and contracted writing\nAcronyms and abbreviations: “cmq” (comunque = anyway), “xké” (perché = why/because), “tvb” (ti voglio bene = I love you), “grz” (grazie = thanks).\nGraphic reduction for speed and practicality → born with SMS (where characters were limited) and continued today out of habit.\nUse of numbers instead of letters or syllables: “6” = sei (you are/six), “x” = per (for), “tvtb” = ti voglio tanto bene (I love you very much).\n2. Emojis and emoticons\nThey replace entire words or sentences, often becoming emotional markers (❤️ for love, 😂 for laughter).\nParalinguistic function: they fill the absence of tone, gestures, expressions.\nThey can become cultural symbols or even autonomous languages (e.g., telling a story only with emojis).\n3. Anglicisms and hybridizations\nBorrowings from English are increasingly widespread: “like,” “spoilerare” (to spoil), “cringe,” “shoppare” (to shop), “shippare” (to ship).\nHybridizations between languages (Itanglese, Spanglish, Hinglish).\nOn social media and in gaming, global slang expressions emerge, understood by international communities.\n4. Memetics and ironic languages\nMeme culture → recurring linguistic formulas (“ok boomer,” “sus” from Among Us, “based,” “ratio”).\nOften quotations transformed into an internal code for those belonging to a community.\nMemes create digital idioms that then spread to spoken language.\n5. Written orality\nWriting in chat tends to imitate speech:\nuse of ellipses “...” to simulate pauses;\nrepeated letters (“hellooo,” “nooo”) to mark intonation;\nall caps to shout (“STOP”).\nThe distinction between written and spoken language becomes blurred.\n6. Speed and simplification\nBrevity is central: quick messages, broken up into multiple sends (the “rapid-fire messages” style of chat).\nReduction of punctuation, fragmented sentences, simplified grammar.\nPriority: immediate effectiveness over correctness.\n7. Digital neologisms\nA constant creation of new words linked to online phenomena: “googlare” (to google), “instagrammabile” (instagrammable), “ghostare” (to ghost), “binge-watchare” (to binge-watch).\nHybrid verbs: often English root + Italian ending.\n8. Multimodality and code hybridization\nText + image + audio/video → increasingly hybrid messages (stickers, gifs, voice notes).\nThe communicative act is no longer only written: it integrates multiple codes in a single flow.\n9. Identity, community, and “group languages”\nEach platform (TikTok, Twitch, Discord, Instagram) develops its own slang.\nLanguage becomes a marker of belonging: you know you’re part of a group if you recognize and use certain expressions.\n10. Side effects\nErosion of norms: grammar and spelling less respected.\nDigital diglossia: learning to distinguish when to use “chat language” and when a formal register.\nFear of purists: but in reality these are historical phenomena → language always adapts to new media.",
