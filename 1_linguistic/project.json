It is not limited to war or explicit clashes: it emerges within collective life as friction, as a continuous confrontation between competing needs, systems, and visions.\nIt is not a punctual episode but a latent and distributed condition. It takes on asymmetric, often invisible forms, embedded in cultural practices, social relations, and infrastructures. Its logic is not confined to violence: it also structures coexistence, shaping who holds privilege and who is pushed to the margins.\nExploring distributed conflicts means reading the present as a field where techniques of offense multiply and blur into the infrastructures society depends on. The goal is to generate critical devices, scenarios, and questions that probe the ambiguous nature of conflict as a diffuse condition in a post-territorial age.",

A language is therefore a system of communication composed of various subsystems. The principal components of a language include the lexicon, the phonological system, morphology, syntax, and pragmatics; when both spoken and written forms are present, a writing system must also be considered.\nLinguistics is the discipline devoted to the study of languages, with the aim of understanding the uniquely human capacity for language. Ferdinand de Saussure was the first scholar to endow linguistics with empirical methods and with the scientific objectivity characteristic of the natural sciences. His theories, later collected under the designation of structuralism, earned him recognition by many as the founding figure of modern linguistics.",

They perceive the world in geographic rather than egocentric terms.\nPirahã (Amazon, Brazil)\nThey lack precise numbers; only the concepts of “few” and “many” exist.\nThis alters the perception of quantity itself: for them, there is no “seven fish,” only “some fish.” They live in an immediate present, without the mathematical abstraction as understood in Western cultures.\nYupik (Inuit populations of Alaska)\nThey have over 90 terms for snow, not merely as a substance but as an event, process, or outcome.\nFor example, there are distinct words for “snow falling in large flakes,” “freshly fallen soft snow,” and “snow compacted by wind.” This is not simple synonymy but a perceptual mapping of the landscape, which is vital for them.\nDani (Papua New Guinea)\nThey have only two words for colors: “mili” (dark, cool: black, blue, green) and “mola” (light, warm: red, yellow, white).\nThey do not distinguish blue from green or yellow from white, because the chromatic world is reduced to two categories. Color is thus perceived as polarity rather than as a spectrum.\nAymara (Andes, Bolivia/Peru)\nTheir perception of time is inverted:\nPast = in front (visible)\nFuture = behind (not visible)\nFor them, the future comes from behind the back, and the past lies before the eyes—a true reversal of our mental image of time.\nBassa (Liberia, Africa)\nThe language lacks words for numbers beyond five; quantities above this are expressed through combinations and metaphors.\nThis lexical limitation results in a very different perception of quantity: mathematics is not an innate tool in their worldview.\nKalaallisut (Greenland, Inuit)\nSingle word: “qangatasuukkuvimmuuriaqalaaqtunga” = “I have to go to the airport.”\nThe language is polysynthetic: a concept that requires an entire sentence in Italian is expressed as a single word.
